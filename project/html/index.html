<p>My Family tree!
In the next few weeks I will begin to explore my family tree. My mother name is Doris Ann Woodford and her maiden name is Doris Ann Walker.</p>
I'm already having a vision for this sight, but input is gratly appreciated.
For now I will concentrate on my immediate family of my mother. hopefully this will build in time to capture my father side and there siblings.
I will <strong>EXPLORE</strong> all informtion received. I hope this lead to something great for generations.
<em>God! Family!</em>
<h5>Freda Mozee is my mother's mother. My Grandmother. She had eight kids.</h5>
