<h2><em>Parent/Guardian Declaration and Contract of E</em></h2> <hr /> 
<p>The person/s whose details appear in Annexure &lsquo;B&rsquo;, declare that he/she/they are the parent/s or legal guardian/s of the Child/Children, whose details appear in Annexure &ldquo;A1&rdquo; and any supplementary issue thereof. Each parent, alive and of full capacity, must complete these details and sign this contract. If one parent is the custodian parent, then the non-custodian parent, if not a signatory, must affirm in writing his or her consent hereto as a pre-condition. The rights and obligations contained in this Contract are binding on every person who signs this Contract and must be carried out in order for the Child to be successfully enrolled and retained at the School.</p> 
<h3>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h3> 
<p>By signing or initialling or otherwise entering into this Contract you agree to the terms and conditions contained in this document as well as any terms and conditions contained in the Policies of the School, which form part of this Contract. If there is any provision in this Contract that you do not understand, please ask for an explanation before signing.</p> 
<p>Your attention is drawn to these clauses because they are important and should be carefully noted. The rights you have in this contract are in addition to and do not affect the statutory rights and remedies you have under consumer protection law. In the event of conflict between this contract and consumer protection law, you statutory consumer protection rights will prevail. Nothing in this document is intended to or must be understood to unlawfully restrict, limit or avoid any rights or obligations created for you or the School in terms of the Consumer Protection Act.</p> 
<h3>GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE SCHOOL</h3> 
<p>The admission and enrolment of learners to the School is at the discretion of the Principal, acting in terms of the School&rsquo;s Admission Policy, who may refuse a learner&rsquo;s admission to the School without giving reasons therefore and may grant temporary or provisional enrolment to the School subject to such further terms and conditions which the Principal may impose. The Principal may, at his/her sole discretion, cancel enrolment in accordance with the Rules.</p> 
<p>For the sake of clarity, this Agreement regulates the enrolment and admission of your Child to the School and also regulates the relationship between the School, your Child, yourself and/or a Third Party once your Child is admitted and enrolled with the School. Subject to clause 2.1, nothing in this Agreement should be interpreted as a representation or warranty made by the School that your Child will be admitted to and enrolled with the School.</p> 
<p>While your Child remains a pupil of the School, we undertake to exercise reasonable skill and care in respect of his her education and welfare. This obligation will apply during school hours and at other times when your Child is permitted to be on School premises or is participating in activities organised by the School.</p> 
<p>We shall monitor your Child&rsquo;s progress at the School and produce regular written reports. We will advise you if we have any concern about your Child&rsquo;s progress, but we do not undertake to diagnose any learning disability or other condition: a formal assessment can be arranged either by you or by the School at your expense.</p> 
<p>The parties take cognisance of the limitations of the School&rsquo;s physical environment, facilities and resources which limit its ability to provide high quality education to children with special educational needs (whether due to neurological barriers, hearing impairments, visual barriers, physical barriers, behavioural or emotional barriers or any other medically assessed special need). To the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of the Principal, taken with the best interests of the Child as a key criterion, the School cannot, or can no longer, provide adequately for your Child&rsquo;s special educational needs, the School may not offer enrolment with the School or may cancel this contract in terms of clause 9.3.</p> 
<h3>DISCLAIMERS</h3> 
<p>You acknowledge that the School does not take any responsibility for any theft or loss of, or damage or destruction to any property of whatever nature (including School clothing, sporting equipment, books, or any other personal possessions) bought on to the School premises by your Child, unless the School or its staff are in the physical possession of that property and damage occurs to that property either because:</p> 
<p>Unless you expressly notify us in writing to the contrary, you consent to your Child participating, under supervision, both in and outside the School, in sports and other activities (including contact sports) which may entail some risk of physical injury, as well to your Child travelling to and participating in School activities and programmes outside the School. Subject to the School taking reasonable care to avoid harm and save for any gross negligence on the part of the school, its employees or agents, the School is not responsible for loss or damage resulting from such sports, activities or programmes and you indemnify the School against any claims in that regard.</p> 
<h3>PARENT&rsquo;S GENERAL OBLIGATIONS</h3> 
<p>You will inform the School in writing, prior to the School entering into this Contract, of any special educational needs of your Child known to you, of the kind referred to in clause 2.5.<br /> 
In order to fulfil our obligations, we need your co-operation. Without detracting from any specific obligations contained in this contract, you are required to: fulfil your own obligations under these terms and conditions; encourage your Child in his or her studies, and give appropriate support at home; keep the School informed of matters which affect your Child; maintain a courteous and constructive relationship with School staff; and attend meetings and otherwise keep in touch with the School where your Child&rsquo;s interests require you to do so.</p> 
<p>remove your Child if your behaviour is, in the reasonable opinion of the Principal, so unreasonable as to affect or likely affect the progress of your Child or another child (or other children) at the School or the well-being of the School staff or to bring the School into disrepute; or</p> 
<p>remove or may suspend or expel your Child from the School, if he/she considers that your Child&rsquo;s attendance, progress or behaviour (including behaviour outside school) is seriously unsatisfactory and in the reasonable opinion of the Principal the Child&rsquo;s removal is in the School&rsquo;s best interests or those of your Child, other children or the wider School community; and</p> 
<p>in either case, you will be asked to remove your Child either immediately and without notice, or at a specified date that is shorter than full term, with or without notice in any form, as is reasonable under the circumstances, and the School will not be required to give you a full term&rsquo;s written notice under these circumstances, but should the Principal exercise this right any prepaid fees applicable to a period after termination less, any amounts owing, will be refunded to you.</p> 
<p>The School rules set out in the Parent Handbook has examples of offences likely to be punishable by suspension or expulsion. These examples are not a closed list and a child may be expelled or suspended for offences which are not included in these examples. In particular, the Principal may decide that suspension or expulsion for a lesser offence is justified where there has been previous misbehaviour by the child or the circumstances of the case otherwise justify such action.</p> 
<h3>POLICIES OF THE SCHOOL</h3> 
<p>You declare that you have read and understood the Policies of the School as adopted and may have been published from time to time and agree to abide by these. The School undertakes to make these available on its website or to you on request.</p> 
<p>You undertake to comply with all the rules and regulations of the School and acknowledge that it is your responsibility to make yourself familiar with the policies.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you are responsible for your Child, whether on the property of the School or not, after the notified finishing times of any school activity/event/function and that you will ensure that your Child obeys all school rules and policies where they apply to the Child.</p> 
<h3>ACCEPTANCE AND APPLICATION FEE</h3> 
<p>An Application Fee shall be paid on handing in the Application Forms</p> 
<p>A further payment of the first month&rsquo;s school fees are payable when tendering this Contract (if you have elected to pay fees on a monthly basis) or of the first half of your annual yearly fees when tendering this Contract (if you have elected to pay the year&rsquo;s fees in advance, with the remaining half to be paid in full on or before the first day of the term when tuition starts.</p> 
<p>You have absolute responsibility for the payment of any Fees applicable to your Child attending the School. You also acknowledge that School fees are payable in advance and that only debit orders are the only acceptable forms of payment in the case of monthly school fees. If you are unclear about any of your financial obligations, the school will on request provide a written explanation. Any Fee or other moneys owing by you to the School not paid on or before the due date will bear interest at the maximum rate of interest for incidental credit prescribed from time to time in terms of the National Credit Act, 2005 (&lsquo;NCA&rsquo;), or at such lesser rate as the School determines from time to time in its sole discretion. Interest not paid to the School by the last day of the month in respect of which such interest accrues will bear further interest at the same rate. In addition to interest the School will be entitled to recover from you default administration costs and collection costs, as contemplated in the NCA, including legal costs on the attorney and client scale and collection commission to the extent permitted by the NCA.</p> 
<h3>PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3> 
<p>By entering into this contract, and unless you at any time instruct the School expressly and in writing to the contrary, your consent is given for the School to:</p> 
<p>collect, store and process credit information about you and any Third Party or divorced or separated Parent responsible for payment of any or all amounts comprised in the Fees;</p> 
<p>collect, store and process names, contact details and information relating to yourself and your Child, and to such information being made available to other parents/guardians, staff or responsible persons engaged or authorised by the School for School-related purposes to the extent required for the purpose of managing relationships between the School, parents/guardians, and current learners as well as providing references and communicating with the body of former learners;</p> 
<h3><a name="Termination Procedure"></a>TERMINATION AND NOTICE REQUIREMENTS<h3> 
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this contract will terminate when your Child completes the School&rsquo;s curriculum and any exit examination we offer at the end of your Child&rsquo;s schooling, unless otherwise terminated on the terms of this contract. This contract therefore has an indefinite term.</p> 
<p>You have the right to cancel this contract at any time, for any reason, provided that you give the School a full term&rsquo;s notice, in writing, of this intention before the withdrawal of the Child from the School. Alternatively, a full term&rsquo;s fees (including Additional Fees pro-rated for the term) is payable to the School in lieu of notice, and as a reasonable cancellation fee taking into account the nature of the educational services, capacity planning and reasonable potential to fill the vacancy. Such amount is due and payable on the first day of the term which would have been the final term if the appropriate notice had been given. Should you have elected to pay annual school fees or should any additional fees have been paid in advance, those fees will be credited in proportion to the terms remaining, less any amount payable in lieu of appropriate notice.</p> 
<h3><a name="General"></a>GENERAL</h3> 
<p>You choose the residential address set out in the annexure &lsquo;B&rsquo; as your chosen legal address for the service of all notices and legal process and the postal and e mail addresses for all other communications by the School to you.</p>
<p>You confirm that all the particulars that you may furnish or that you have furnished to the School on this contract or otherwise from time to time are or will be, to the best of your knowledge and belief, full, true and accurate.</p> 
<h3>JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW</h3> 
<p>The contract between you and the School is governed by South African law.</p> 
<h3>VARIATIONS</h3> 
<p>We reserve the right to change or add to these terms and conditions from time to time for legal, safety or other substantive reasons or in order to assist the proper delivery or education at the School. The School will give you at least a term&rsquo;s notice of any such modifications.</p> 
<h3>PARTIAL INVALIDITY</h3> 
<p>Each term and condition contained in this agreement is separate from the other terms and conditions in the sense that if anyone is determined to be illegal and unenforceable, it will simply be disregarded and of no force and effect. But the agreement will otherwise remain valid.</p> 
<h3><a name="Child"></a>DETAILS OF THE CHILD OR CHILDREN</h3> <p>It is agreed that for each sibling enrolled and admitted to the School after the Child or Children referred to in this Annexure A1, a new annexure will be completed and signed by the Parties, with the same information for each additional sibling. These will be Annexures A2, A3 and so on sequentially, and will be initialled by the parties and will be deemed to be annexures to the Contract, with all the provisions of the Contract applying to the sibling as a Child in terms of the Contract</p>
